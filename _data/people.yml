  bio: >
    I am an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) in Process Systems Engineering in the
    Department of Chemical Engineering at UCL. I am also an Early Career Advisory
    Board member of Control Engineering Practice, a journal of the International
    Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC).

    I hold a PhD in Earth Science and Engineering from Imperial College London and
    obtained MEng and MSc degrees in Chemical Engineering from Universidad Técnica
    Federico Santa María in Valparaíso, Chile. I previously worked as a Postdoctoral
    Researcher at the Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Imperial
    College London, and was appointed Assistant Professor at Brunel University
    London in 2024.
