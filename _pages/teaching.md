## Guest Lecturer:

### At Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London. 

Module: 

* **Mining Geology & Engineering**: The module provides students with an understanding of key aspects of how geological and engineering knowledge is applied to the discovery of ore deposits, and development of mines, devising efficient mining and mineral processing methodologies and sustainable legacies. I specifically taught a session on mineral processing and flowsheet design, covering topics of mineral processing routes, unit operations, mass balances and calculations.

### At Department of Chemical Engineering,  Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Santiago, Chile.

Modules:

* **Process Control Seminar**: I taught basic theory on feedback control. The main part of this course was for students to set up an experimental rig from the calibration of instruments to its connection to PLCs, control logic, and create an HMI (human-machine interface) using Intouch Wonderware software.

* **Statistical Design and Analysis of Industrial Experiments**: Applied Statistics and probability for engineers, including continuous random variables and probability distributions, joint probability distributions, statistic intervals, test of hypotheses,  statistical inference for two samples, linear regression, and design of experiments with several factors.
